# Launch. fs_portable 1 + an absolute fs_homepath keep every file the client writes (settings,
# saved profiles, screenshots) inside this folder instead of ~/Library/Application Support -- an
# absolute path is used here (rather than ".") because "open" does not guarantee the launched app
# inherits this script's working directory.
# GalaxyRP fix: [TaystJK] the TaystJK client (unlike the dedicated server) defaults fs_forcegame
# to "taystjk", which unconditionally overwrites fs_gamedir back to "taystjk" at the end of
# FS_Startup -- after fs_game GalaxyRP has already added GalaxyRP to the search path, but before
# the engine decides where to actually WRITE files. Game content still loads fine from GalaxyRP
# (it's on the search path), but screenshots, saved configs, and demos would silently land in
# <fs_homepath>/taystjk/ instead of GalaxyRP/. Setting fs_forcegame explicitly to GalaxyRP here
# neutralizes that override (fs_forcegame ends up equal to fs_gamedir, so the override no-ops)
# and makes GalaxyRP the actual write target too.
