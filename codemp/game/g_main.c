// GalaxyRP fix: [Database] every prepare in the game module is sqlite3_prepare_v2(), not the
// legacy sqlite3_prepare(). They take identical arguments; what differs is how sqlite3_step()
// behaves afterwards, and both differences cost us something real:
//
//   1. Error detail. With the legacy interface a failing step() returns a bare SQLITE_ERROR and
//      sqlite3_errmsg() says "SQL logic error" -- the actual reason is only available from
//      sqlite3_finalize()'s return value, which nothing in this codebase reads. So every one of
//      the ~107 trap->Print("SQL error: %s", sqlite3_errmsg(db)) lines in the database layer
//      reported "SQL logic error" for any constraint failure. Measured against our own bundled
//      amalgamation, the same duplicate-username INSERT reports:
//
//          legacy : rc=1  "SQL logic error"
//          _v2    : rc=19 "UNIQUE constraint failed: Accounts.Username"
//
//      That matters here specifically because Accounts.Username now HAS a UNIQUE index (see
//      statement_username_unique_index in InitializeGalaxyRpTables below), so a duplicate
//      registration is a reachable failure that insert_accounts_table_row() was fixed to report --
//      and it was reporting it uselessly.
//
//   2. Schema changes. If the schema changes between prepare() and step(), the legacy interface
//      fails the query outright; _v2 recompiles the statement and runs it. This is reachable for
//      us: DB_PATH resolves against fs_homepath, so two server instances on one machine share the
//      database file, and InitializeGalaxyRpTables() runs its ALTER TABLE batch on every map load.
//      One instance migrating while the other has a statement prepared silently loses that other
//      query -- a character load, typically. WAL (which RP_DB_Open sets) widens the window rather
//      than narrowing it, because a writer is no longer blocked by a reader.
//
// The third documented _v2 difference -- recompiling when a bound value could change the query
// plan -- needs LIKE/GLOB or SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT4, and we have neither. It does not apply.
//
// Nothing else changes. No call site in this codebase tests a specific failure code (every one
// checks != SQLITE_OK, != SQLITE_DONE, or != SQLITE_ROW && != SQLITE_DONE), so a step that now
// returns SQLITE_CONSTRAINT instead of SQLITE_ERROR takes the identical branch; only the logged
// text differs. SQLITE_BUSY was already passed through unchanged by both interfaces, so none of
// the "database is locked" handling in RP_DB_Open() is affected. The sqlite3_exec() sites needed
// nothing -- exec has always used prepare_v2 internally, which is why exec failures in this file
// already reported properly while prepare failures did not.
//
// Note this is not something the 3.53.4 bump forced: _v2 has existed since 2007, the old 3.8.8.3
// amalgamation behaved identically, and sqlite3_prepare() carries no SQLITE_DEPRECATED attribute
// and is not behind SQLITE_OMIT_DEPRECATED. It is not going away. This is a diagnostics fix.

// GalaxyRP fix: [Database] "database is locked" (SQLITE_BUSY) fix. Every database access in the
// game module opens its own short-lived sqlite3 connection to the same on-disk file via plain
// sqlite3_open(), with no shared connection and no busy handler. SQLite's rollback-journal default
// is to fail a write *immediately* with SQLITE_BUSY/SQLITE_LOCKED if another connection already
// holds the write lock, instead of waiting. InitializeGalaxyRpTables() below runs a batch of
// ALTER TABLE statements on every single map load (it's called unconditionally from G_InitGame),
// at exactly the moment reconnecting clients are opening their own connections to read/save their
// character row -- so map change routinely produced "database is locked" errors on whichever side
// lost the race, which is why players could come back from a map change with no weapons/inventory
// (their load query failed) until a /kill forced a retry once the lock had cleared.
//
// RP_DB_Open() is a drop-in replacement for sqlite3_open(DB_PATH, &db) that (1) sets a busy
// timeout so a connection that does collide with another writer blocks and retries for up to
// RP_DB_BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS instead of failing outright, and (2) switches the database to WAL
// journal mode, where readers no longer block a writer and a writer no longer blocks readers --
// which removes the vast majority of the contention in the first place. WAL mode is a persistent
// property of the database file (only needs to succeed once), but PRAGMA journal_mode is cheap
// and idempotent, so it's simplest to just set it on every open.
//
// GalaxyRP fix: [Database] DB_PATH ("GalaxyRP/database/accounts.db") is a relative filesystem
// path, and sqlite3_open() resolves it against the server process's actual OS working directory
// -- NOT against fs_homepath/fs_basepath/fs_game, which the rest of the engine's virtual
// filesystem uses. That only happened to work as long as the server was launched with its
// working directory set to exactly the folder containing GalaxyRP (e.g. via galaxyrp_host.bat's
// `cd..` before launching), and breaks silently with "unable to open database file" for any
// other launch method (double-clicking the engine exe directly, a shortcut with a different
// "Start in" folder, launching from an IDE, etc.) -- the working directory just isn't guaranteed
// to be right. Resolve it against fs_homepath instead, which the engine already knows

GalaxyRP: [SP Maps] Jedi Outcast single-player maps

The Jedi Outcast SP maps load in Jedi Academy multiplayer but were never part of Zyk's SP map list
above: each has exactly one spawn point (its info_player_start), so everyone who spawns together
telefrags. This adds 3-4 spawn points to every one of the 28, and on bespin_streets makes the doors,
lifts and start lift that only single-player scripts moved usable by players.

Spawn points. For 23 maps they sit 40-80 units from the original start, facing the same way, and
were picked by testing each candidate against the map's own geometry (read from the .bsp): a clear
player box and a clear path from the start, level solid floor within 24 units of the start's, no
water/slime/lava, no hurt/teleport/push trigger down to the floor, nothing within 16 units of a
door or lift, and 40+ units from every other spawn point (the player box is 30 wide, so closer
would telefrag). On five maps where the start is on a moving lift, inside a moving bin, in a
shuttle over a hurt zone or on a slope, the points were placed in game and checked the same way.

The original start is kept, except where it stands on or in something that moves:
  - ns_starpad: at the bottom of a script-driven elevator ride of some 6,700 units;
  - ns_hideout: inside a moving bin under a low ceiling;
  - bespin_streets: on the start lift's deck, which RP_FixBespinStreets() below makes rest at the
    top -- its column then fills the bottom of the shaft, so a spawn there would be inside it.
Its target is read before it is removed, and every added point carries it, as Zyk's helper copies
it: it is the map's single-player start script. level.rp_spawn_target_once makes it fire for the
first spawn only (ClientSpawn(), g_client.c).

Lift calls

A use-panel that sends a lift to its other end. A func_door that is not TOGGLE, used while it is
waiting at its far end (pos2), only restarts its wait -- so pressing the panel at the lift's
resting landing to call it back would keep it away longer instead, and on bespin_streets' start
lift that means holding a 1,728-unit shaft open in the street. So every panel goes through one of
these: resting at pos1 -> a normal use, and it travels to pos2; waiting at pos2 -> it heads back
now instead of after its wait; moving -> ignored, so nobody reverses it under a rider. Every press
therefore means "go to the other end".

RP_FixBespinStreets

In single player an R5 droid's scripts unlock three doors and the player's scripts run the lifts;
without those scripts nothing here moves. Fixed as follows:
  - locked_door1/2/3 (the droid's doors), copdoors (a locked double door) and bigdoor (the hangar
    door, a 1,000-damage crusher): opened and removed with Zyk's fix_sp_func_door(), matched on
    func_door as well as the name -- "copdoors" is also a target_deactivate's name. A door's team
    partners go with it (copdoors is a two-door team, and G_FindTeams() has moved the partner's
    name onto the master), and team links are cut first: moving a door team relinks every member,
    and a partner already freed must not be;
  - lift1-lift5: they already have a use-panel (trigger_multiple, USE_BUTTON) at each landing
    that fired a single-player script; the panels now target a lift call for their lift, and the
    lifts wait 5 seconds at the far end instead of 3;
  - uplift, the start lift -- a deck on a 1,728-unit hydraulic column, START_OPEN|TOGGLE, resting
    at the bottom until a script raised it: it now rests at the top (START_OPEN's position swap
    undone, not TOGGLE, 5-second wait), since at street level the shaft is open with floor right
    up to its edge and a lift resting at the bottom would leave that drop open; at the top the
    deck closes the street and the column fills the shaft. It gets a use-trigger over each
    landing, 48 units wider than the shaft and 88 high, built from its own bounds. Renamed, so a
    leftover script cannot drive it;
  - the R5 droid stood on the lift deck, inside the column now: its spawner (which spawns it after
    this has run) moves beside the new spawn points, clear of the lift trigger, facing the lift.

GalaxyRP fix: [Ally] the raw bitfield test, with no other conditions attached.

An ally list is two ints: ally1 holds client slots 0-15 and ally2 holds 16 and up at bit
(slot - 16). That split was open-coded in four places -- here, zyk_add_ally(), zyk_remove_ally()
and ClientDisconnect() -- which is three chances for them to disagree. Reading now goes through
this one function, and writing already went through the add/remove pair.

It also removes an undefined shift. zyk_is_ally() used to read:

    if (slot > 15 && (ally2 & (1 << (slot - 16)))) return qtrue;
    else if (ally1 & (1 << slot))                  return qtrue;

The else branch runs whenever the first condition is false -- including when the slot IS above 15
and its ally2 bit simply is not set. That evaluated 1 << slot for slots up to 31, and 1 << 31 on a
signed int is undefined behaviour. It also asked ally1 about a slot ally1 never stores, so a stray
bit in its high half would have reported a stranger as an ally. Branching on the slot number
rather than on the bit test makes both impossible.

NPC_CheckCharmed() ended up clearing the leader without the order bits. One function now.

goalEntity is cleared too when it is the leader: NPC_BSFollowLeader() parks the leader there as
the move goal whenever it closes or backs off, and NPC_SlideMoveToGoal() reads
goalEntity->r.currentOrigin without an inuse test. G_ClearEnemy() does the same for the enemy

GalaxyRP fix: [NPC] should this NPC still be following the player it is following?

TryUse() tests OnSameTeam() once, at the moment the Use key claims the NPC, and nothing ever
looked again. Everything that test depends on can change a second later, and none of it did
anything: the leader could go to spectator and keep an escort walking to wherever
SpectatorClientEndFrame() had copied their playerState origin to -- for a following spectator
that is the position of whoever they are watching, so an NPC could be aimed at a live player it
was never given to -- or simply switch team and keep NPCs claimed as the other side.

Note that re-running OnSameTeam() by itself catches none of this. Its player-versus-NPC arm
returns qtrue for any ET_PLAYER against an ET_NPC on NPCTEAM_PLAYER and returns before it ever
looks at sessionTeam, so it reads the same both before and after any team change, spectator
included. The conditions that actually change are spelled out here instead.

Red/blue switches are handled where they happen, in SetTeam() and SetTeamQuick(); this is the
per-frame net under them, for the routes that write sessionTeam directly and never call either
(StopFollowing() is the obvious one).

Two kinds of link are deliberately out of scope. Mind Trick 3 charm sets leader as well, but
NPC_CheckCharmed() owns that link and restores the NPC's original teams when charmedTime runs
out, so it is left alone. ICARUS SET_LEADER can name another NPC as the leader, and a map script
pointing one NPC at another has nothing to do with the Use key.
*/
/*
Stop an NPC under a /order guard from walking after the player it is guarding for.

/order guard sets NPC->tempBehavior = BS_STAND_GUARD, and the behaviour that name promises --
NPC_BSStandGuard(), which issues no movement at all -- is only ever reached from inside
NPC_BSFollowLeader(), whose opening test reads the guard bit. But BS_STAND_GUARD routes the NPC
AWAY from NPC_BSFollowLeader: NPC_RunBehavior() dispatches by class, and thirteen of the seventeen
behaviour sets map BS_STAND_GUARD onto their own <class>_Default AI instead (NPC_BehaviorSet_Jedi
-> NPC_BSJedi_Default, NPC_BehaviorSet_Stormtrooper -> NPC_BSST_Default, and so on). Those AIs end
with the shape

	if ( UpdateGoal() ) { ucmd.buttons |= BUTTON_WALKING; NPC_MoveToGoal( qtrue ); }

and goalEntity is still the leader, left there by NPC_BSFollowLeader() while the NPC was following
-- /order guard never clears it. So the NPC kept following, and because those paths force
BUTTON_WALKING unconditionally while the real follow code only walks inside a short close-range
band, it followed at walk speed instead of run speed. That speed difference is what the bug looked
like from the outside; the following itself was the actual defect.

Dropping the goal when it is the leader is deliberately the whole fix. It is the one thing that
makes the NPC walk toward the player, and clearing it leaves every other part of the class AI
untouched -- enemy acquisition, shooting, repositioning, cover, class-specific moves. NPCs whose
behaviour set does fall through to NPC_BehaviorSet_Default keep working exactly as before, because
NPC_BSDefault() reacts to a null goal by calling NPC_BSFollowLeader(), which reads the guard bit and
lands on NPC_BSStandGuard() -- the intended behaviour, reached by the route that already worked.

Scoped by the guard bit and by the goal actually being the leader, so a map- or script-spawned NPC
is untouched: those never carry bit 18, which only Cmd_Order_f() sets.
*/
/*
Can this NPC be given a /order?

The three verbs used to repeat one condition three times, which is how the two gaps below went
unnoticed. One test now, so the three branches cannot drift apart.

CLASS_WAMPA and CLASS_REMOTE are excluded for the same reason CLASS_VEHICLE already was: their AI
never reads the behaviour state, so no order can change what they do. NPC_RunBehavior() calls
NPC_BSWampa_Default() directly for a wampa and discards bState entirely, and
NPC_BehaviorSet_Remote() ignores its bState parameter and always calls NPC_BSRemote_Default(). But
/order guard and /order cover also set bits 18 and 19, and NPC_ValidEnemy() reads those to decide
that anyone not on the leader's ally list is a valid target -- reached from these classes through
NPC_CheckEnemyExt() -> NPC_FindEnemy() -> NPC_ValidEnemy(). So on those two classes an order moved
nothing and changed nothing visible, while quietly turning the NPC on its own side. Note this is
NOT true of the rancor, which looks similar but is fine: NPC_BehaviorSet_Rancor() has no
BS_FOLLOW_LEADER case and so falls through to NPC_BehaviorSet_Default(), which does handle it.

Charmed NPCs are excluded because the command was the only part of the order system that did not
already skip them. zyk_npc_leader_lost() and zyk_release_player_npcs() both bail on charmedTime, on
the grounds that NPC_CheckCharmed() owns the leader link for as long as the charm lasts -- but
Cmd_Order_f() would happily stamp an order onto a charmed NPC, and those same release paths then
refused to take it off again. Ordering one meant its leader and order bits survived a team change
or a switch to spectator that would have cleared them for any other NPC, leaving it hunting its own
team on behalf of someone no longer in the game.

// quest_power_status bit 0 -- the Immunity Power, which zyk_check_immunity_power() tests to block
// quest and magic damage -- along with quest_power1_timer, the duel's SCHEDULED end. Nothing
// cleared the bit when a duel finished early, and the only other clear ran once that original
// deadline passed, so a duelist who won at ten seconds of a sixty-second match kept magic immunity
// for the remaining fifty -- through the score screen, the next pairing, and into their next duel
// or open play. Losers were covered by accident (player_die zeroes the whole of
// quest_power_status) and so was anyone who spectated (ClientSpawn does the same); only the
// survivor leaked it, which is exactly the player it most advantaged. The clear added here fixed
// that.
//
// Both halves have since gone: bit 0 lost its last reader when the magic effect functions lost
// theirs, so the set in prepare(), the clear below and quest_power1_timer were all removed. If the
// immunity is ever reintroduced, reintroduce the SET AND THE CLEAR TOGETHER -- one without the

// walked out under their own steam with a second /meleemode never reached it: that branch (g_cmds.c)
// clears level.melee_players[] for them first, so melee_battle_end()'s loop skips them even when
// their departure is what ends the battle. They kept melee_battle_prepare()'s loadout -- WP_MELEE
// only, binoculars only, fourteen force powers cleared from forcePowersKnown -- until their next
// death or a map change. Lifted into its own function so the leave path and the end path restore
// through the same code and cannot drift apart.
//
// GalaxyRP fix: [Melee Battle] this did not restore anything -- it re-issued a baseline. The body
// was WP_InitForcePowers() plus an unconditional WP_BRYAR_PISTOL and a conditional saber, because
// melee_battle_prepare() took a loadout away without ever writing it down. Everyone who fought
// therefore walked out having permanently lost every holdable item (sentry gun, seeker, medpacs,
// jetpack, cloak -- prepare replaces the whole field with binoculars) and every weapon except
// saber and Bryar, including anything picked up off the map or handed to them with /give guns.
// WP_InitForcePowers() had the same shape of problem: it rebuilt force powers from the client's
// vanilla JKA Profile allocation rather than from what the player actually had.
//
// The Duel Tournament had exactly this defect and was given a real backup/restore pair; the
// Melee Battle now uses the same one, so the two mini-games strip and restore through identical
// code. Both halves self-guard on their validity flag, which is what makes this safe to call on
// a player who was never prepared: melee_battle_end() reaches the whole roster including players
// signed up for a battle that never started, and for them both calls are no-ops rather than the
// free Bryar Pistol and profile force-rebuild the old body handed out.
//
// Order matches the duel's mode-5 block: force first, then loadout. player_restore_loadout()
// ASSIGNS stats[STAT_WEAPONS] while player_restore_force() only ORs WP_MELEE into it, so the
// reverse order would discard the assignment.
//
// An initialize_rpg_skills(ent) call used to close this function, for RPG characters who could
// get into a battle while the amrpgmode==2 join guard in Cmd_MeleeMode_f was commented out. That

			// powers out of sess.selected_left_special_power and special powers out of
			// sess.selected_special_power.
			//
			// Nothing has ever been able to set that status bit. The name appears exactly twice in the
			// whole tree -- its enum entry in g_local.h and the single read that used to be on this
			// line -- there is no "player_statuses |= (1 << PLAYER_STATUS_CUSTOM_QUEST_NPC)" anywhere,
			// every player_statuses set in the tree uses a literal PLAYER_STATUS_* name rather than a
			// variable bit index, and player_statuses is never restored from the database or the session
			// string -- it is only ever assigned 0 wholesale. So the bit sat at the zero ClientConnect's
			// memset gives it and the block never ran once.
			//
			// Removing it orphaned twelve functions further up this file, which went with it: chaos_power,
			// elemental_attack, force_scream, healing_area, immunity_power, lightning_dome,
			// magic_explosion, time_power, ultra_drain, zyk_force_storm, zyk_no_attack and
			// zyk_super_beam. This block was their only caller; the quest_mage chain that used to sit just
			// below called twenty-seven OTHER effect functions and none of these twelve (that chain has
			// since gone too, and the twenty-seven, kept for a while as reference code, are now deleted
			// as well). None of the
			// twelve was ever taken by address (the zyk_force_storm / zyk_super_beam matches elsewhere are entity
			// targetname strings that happen to share the names, not function pointers).
			//
			// Consequences worth knowing, all of them pre-existing dead weight rather than new:
			// quest_power_status bits 1, 2 and 26 had no setter other than chaos_power, time_power and
			// elemental_attack, so those three bits are now permanently 0 and their ~21 readers across
			// six files are permanently-false tests. Bits 0 and 5 keep other setters. The entity
			// targetname handling for "zyk_force_storm" and "zyk_super_beam" lives in g_misc.c, and
			// zyk_lightning_dome_detonate() (g_weapon.c) and zyk_spawn_ice_element() lost their last
			// callers. All left in place deliberately, to be judged on their own rather than swept up
			// behind this one.
			//
			// Two corrections to the above, made in a later pass. (1) This note also named g_combat.c
			// as holding some of that targetname handling; neither name appears in that file. (2) It
			// said the handling "can no longer be reached either", which was wrong and was the reason
			// a real bug sat unnoticed: the targetname handling is reached by any fx_runner carrying
			// the name, which /entadd, /entedit, a .ent preset or a map can all supply. What the loss
			// of zyk_super_beam() actually removed was the only writer of ent->parent on such an
			// entity -- so the handler ran with a NULL parent and dereferenced it. See the guard and
			// the full account in fx_runner_think() (g_misc.c).

			// GalaxyRP fix: [Guardian] quest guardians special abilities dispatch removed here -- guardian_mode/guardian_invoked_by_id are permanently dead (spawn_boss has no callers); the ~40 magic-power helper functions it called (healing_water, water_splash, ultra_strength, ice_block, earthquake, magic_shield, etc.) were kept as zero-caller code for a while and have since been deleted -- see the note below

			// GalaxyRP fix: [Guardian] ymir_boss and thor_boss ability sub-chains were removed here earlier,
			// and the quest_mage chain that used to follow them has now gone too -- 115 lines picking one of
			// twenty-seven magic powers at random (ultra_strength, poison_mushrooms, water_splash, hurricane,
			// rock_fall, ice_block, ...) every few seconds for any NPC whose NPC_type was "quest_mage".
			//
			// That NPC type no longer exists: it was defined in zyk_quest_enemies.npc, one of the three quest
			// asset files deleted with the magic orphans, so NPC_ParseParms() now fails the name outright and
			// the condition could never be true again. This chain was the last live entry point into the
			// magic effect system.
			//
			// The twenty-seven effect functions themselves were kept for a while as material to repurpose,
			// then deleted in the magic cleanup along with the quest_power_status bitfield they wrote and
			// every reader of it (G_Damage, ClientThink_real, the force-power checks, the flame thrower's
			// Flame Burst bonus). Anyone reviving one of those powers starts from the git history, and
