DEADSOLID - Stay solid even when destroyed (in case damage model is rather large).

"count"  the amount of armor/health/ammo given (default 50)
"gravity"	if set to 1, this will be affected by gravity
"radius"  Chunk code tries to pick a good volume of chunks, but you can alter this to scale the number of spawned chunks. (default 1)  (.5) is half as many chunks, (2) is twice as many chunks

/*
GalaxyRP: [Entity System] additions to misc_model_breakable:

  "light" / "color"  a light on the model, as movers have them: "light" is the radius (default 100 when
                     only "color" is given), "color" red green blue from 0 to 1 (default white). No light
                     without either key; it goes out when the model is destroyed.
  "modelscale"       now scales the model drawn as well as its box, as in single player -- through
                     entityState_t::iModelScale, so 0.01 to 10.23. "zykmodelscale" (a percentage), if
                     given, still decides the drawn size; "modelscale_vec" still scales the box only,
                     since the client can only draw a model scaled the same on every axis.
  AUTOANIMATE (2)    a model with several frames plays them over and over (RP_Animate, one frame per
                     server frame), and stops when destroyed.

And for one the Entity System made (RP_EntitySystemMade: /entadd, /entaddaim, copies, entity files --
never the map's own): with no "mins"/"maxs" (and not spawnflag 65536), its box is the model's own
frame-0 bounds from the md3 file, scaled and turned with it, rather than a 32-unit cube; and its damage
and use models are only registered when those files exist. (A modelscale still lifts the origin by
single player's amount, which keeps the box's bottom where it was; the entity commands that place a
model allow for it -- RP_EntGrabScaleShift() in g_entgrab.c.)

// - Infinite ammo. "Has it got any power left?" was "if (self->count)", i.e. "not exactly 0", and each
//   use took 3 off a default charge of 200 -- not a multiple of 3 -- so the charge went 2 -> -1 -> -4
//   and never landed on 0: once it had been drained it gave forever. Empty is now "0 or less", and
//   the charge is never taken below 0.
// - It ignored the server's ammo caps, filling to the engine's ammoData[] maximums instead (1000
//   blaster / powercell / metal bolts, 100 rockets, 30 of each explosive against caps of 300 / 25 /
//   10). Ammo is saved to the database, so a logged-in character kept the overfill for good. It now
//   fills through Add_Ammo(), to the rp_max_* caps, 10% of the cap per use (minimum 1) as before.
// - It gave explosives to players without the weapon, and emplaced-gun ammo to anyone -- see
//   RP_DispenserMayGiveAmmo().
// - It drained 3 per use whether or not it gave anything, and never stopped its loop sound. It now
//   drains only when it actually gave something, and stops the sound when it doesn't.

		// entityState_t s, which begins with int number -- user_ent->s.number was a read of address
		// zero, i.e. an immediate server crash, not a bad value.
		//
		// That was reachable three ways, the last of them the dangerous one:
		//   /entadd fx_runner targetname zyk_super_beam   (ADM_ENTITYSYSTEM)
		//   /entedit <id> targetname zyk_super_beam       (converts an existing map fx_runner)
		//   a saved preset -- /entsave round-trips the targetname, and g_main.c loads
		//   GalaxyRP/entities/<map>/default.txt automatically ~1s into every map start, with nobody
		//   typing anything. One experiment saved to a preset made that map permanently unbootable.
		//
		// The guard also covers a second, separate hole: the non-client G_Damage below tested
		// "user_ent != target_ent", which is TRUE when user_ent is NULL, and never tested user_ent
		// itself -- so it would have passed NULL as both inflictor and attacker. G_Damage has no
		// NULL substitution at entry here or in stock TaystJK; it survives one only if every
		// internal use happens to be guarded, which is not something to rely on.
		//
		// An ownerless beam now renders and keeps its 100ms cadence (that assignment stays OUTSIDE
		// this guard deliberately -- moving it in would change the tick rate of any map-placed beam
		// to the generic delay default of 200ms) and simply deals no damage, there being nobody to
		// credit it to. The block is otherwise untouched, so it works again unchanged the day
		// something sets parent on an fx_runner once more. The "user_ent &&" inside the first
		// damage branch is redundant now; it is left exactly as it was rather than tidied, so this
