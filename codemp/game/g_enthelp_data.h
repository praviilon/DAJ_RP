/*
===========================================================================
DAJ_RP: [Entity Help] the text /enthelp prints (g_enthelp.c): one entry per spawn-table class, per topic, and per
item classname that has something of its own to say. Written from the multiplayer code as it is (the keys each spawn
function reads, their defaults, the spawnflags it tests), not from the editor's QUAKED comments.

Format (rpEntHelp_t): name, flags (RP_EH_TOPIC / RP_EH_MAPONLY / RP_EH_GAMETYPE / RP_EH_REMOVED -- the last for a class
that removes itself as it spawns whatever its keys: tests_maponly checks it against the code), note (why it is not for
the Entity System, or the gametypes it stays in), text, spawnflags ("value|NAME|meaning" lines), keys ("key|default|meaning"
lines), example (what follows /entadd), also (names to read too). No string may hold a double quote, a ';', a '^' or a
tab: they go out inside print commands. A spawnflag or key line stays under a print (RP_EH_PRINT_MAX). Keep it in step
with the code: the tests (tests_enthelp) check that every class has an entry and that every example spawns.
