DAJ_RP: [Entity Bounds] the Entity Bounds display (/settings 6)

For an admin with the Entity System admin power who has the setting ON (player_settings bit 20, clear ==
ON like every /settings toggle), this draws, for that admin only:

  - the box of the entity being aimed at -- solid entities and trigger volumes alike -- colour-coded by
    kind: triggers yellow, brush entities (doors, movers, statics) green, NPCs and items purple, anything
    else (models and the like) blue. A brush entity's box is its own model bounds turned by its angles,
    which is exactly what the game collides against; every other entity collides as an axis-aligned box,
    and that is what is drawn for it. A short centre-print names it: "#id classname targetname", with the
    G mark /entlist uses for an entity the game made;
  - a small white cross on each of the 8 nearest point and logical entities within 384 units -- spawn
    points, targets, NPC spawners, info_ entities -- which have no size or are not in the world at all,
    so they can never be aimed at.

Adapted from Lugormod's /bounds, with three differences: it follows the aim rather than being toggled
per entity, it is sent to the one admin rather than broadcast to every player, and it never borrows the
entity's own think function (Lugormod's replaced it, so an entity with a think of its own was never
redrawn and a mover stopped while displayed). Everything here runs from ClientEndFrame().

The lines are EV_TESTLINE events, which the stock client already draws (CG_TestLine in cg_effects.c):
nothing on the client side is needed. Each line is a temporary entity, and a temporary entity occupies a
real entity slot for EVENT_VALID_MSEC (300 ms) -- and G_Spawn() ends the server when it runs out -- so
every batch asks G_EntitySlotsAvailable() first, and is skipped rather than drawn into the reserve.

turned by its angles (the engine's transformed box trace), so its bounds are turned by
r.currentAngles about r.currentOrigin; everything else collides as an axis-aligned box and is drawn as
