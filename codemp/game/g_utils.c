// the name anybody meant, so it is refused rather than silently shortened.
//
// Content. BuildShaderStateConfig() joins entries as "%s=%s:%5.2f@" and the client takes them
// apart with strstr on those same three characters (CG_ShaderStateChanged, cg_servercmds.c), so a
// name containing '=', ':' or '@' splits in the wrong place on every machine that parses it. And
// /remapsave writes the table as whitespace-separated tokens, which fscanf reads back the same
// way, so a name containing a space or a newline comes back as two records and shifts every
// record after it -- the whole file silently changes meaning. Q3's tokenizer keeps quoted
// arguments intact (Cmd_TokenizeString, cmd.cpp), so /remap "foo bar" baz really does reach us
// with a space in it.

GalaxyRP fix: [security] keep player-written text from reaching a client as a StringEd reference.

Every "print" and "cp" a client receives goes through CG_CheckSVStringEdRef() (cg_servercmds.c),
which treats three '@' in a row as "insert the server string named by the next word here". That
expansion is how the server's own phrases arrive (G_GetStringEdString() returns "@@@KEY"), but it
also applies to anything a player typed, and the stock client copies the rest of the message after
an expansion with no bound: a line full of "@@@NOCHEATS " overflows its 1024-byte stack buffer and
takes down every client that receives it. Our own cgame is bounded now, but players on the stock
client are not, so the text has to be made harmless before it is sent.

The rule is the one ClientCleanName() (g_client.c) already applies to player names: never three '@'
in a row. The third and every later '@' of a run are dropped; one or two stay as they are, so an
e-mail address or "@@" in a description still reads the same. Only literal runs count -- the client
compares the characters themselves, so "@^1@@" is not a reference and is left alone.

This is for text people write -- descriptions, item names, news, messages, entity keys shown in a
listing. Never run it on a whole line the server built from its own phrases: those are references
on purpose. Works in place; returns the resulting length.

//
// First point every entry at its own shader, with a zero time offset, and send that. Each client
// runs R_RemapShader(S, S, "0") for every entry and restores it. The zero matters: that function
// ends with "sh2->timeOffset = atof(timeOffset)", and on an identity remap sh2 IS the shader being
// restored, so sending the old offset would leave its animation phase shifted.
//
// Only then empty the table and send again, so anyone connecting later gets no remaps either.
// Doing it the other way round would send an empty configstring first and the identity entries
// would never reach anyone -- the remaps would stay on screen until the map changed. Two sends
// rather than one is free here: SV_SetConfigstring (sv_init.cpp) transmits on each call rather than
// deferring to the snapshot, and it is two either way whether the table holds three entries or 128.

// What it cannot undo: shader remaps built into the map itself, the worldspawn "remapshader" and

GalaxyRP: [Saber RGB] Parse a packed 24-bit saber colour.

The value arrives either from a client's cp_sbRGB1/cp_sbRGB2 userinfo cvar (freely settable by the
player, so entirely untrusted) or from the character's database row, and ends up driving a render
tint on every other player's machine -- so it is masked down to the three channels it is allowed to
occupy here rather than anywhere further downstream. Returns 0 for "no custom colour", which is
also what an absent, empty, malformed or negative value degrades to.

Note that 0 is not merely the "unset" marker but also indistinguishable from a literal, deliberately
requested (0,0,0). That ambiguity is fine now: a client-facing packed RGB of 0 falls back to plain
red on the render side (CG_NewClientInfo, matching TaystJK's own legacy-compatibility behaviour), so
"unset" and "asked for pure black" end up rendering the same reasonable way either side of this
function. Anyone who actually wants a true black blade has the dedicated SABER_BLACK palette entry
(/sabercolor <n> black) instead, which carries no RGB payload at all and isn't affected by this.

// finish connecting. The per-table limits are not what you hit first: MAX_MODELS alone is 512
// slots of up to MAX_QPATH each, which is twice the entire byte budget.

//                   server with a map pack puts several kilobytes in this one string.

Slot reuse: RP_SlotTable / RP_SlotMarkUsed / RP_SlotReclaim / RP_SlotRoomFor

GalaxyRP: [Slot Reuse] a model or effect name keeps its configstring slot until the map changes. The
effect table has 64 slots -- shared by the map's effects, every NPC and vehicle type the first time
one spawns, and /admweather's block -- and the models share the gamestate's ~15000 bytes with the
players' info, so a map that stays up for days runs out, and what asked next was drawn with nothing.

A slot whose name only Entity System props ever asked for (level.rp_slot_es_model / _fx is 1:
RP_EntityModelIndex() and RP_EntityEffectIndex() at a prop's own model and effect) can be given to
a new name once nothing points at it any more -- its props were removed -- but only when the new name
cannot be added the ordinary way: the table is full, or the gamestate has no room for another name.
Whatever takes it over decides what it is from then on: an Entity System prop keeps it reusable, any
other caller (an NPC, a vehicle, the map) makes it permanent. Any other request for a name makes its
slot permanent, since the caller may keep the index.

The slot is overwritten in place, never emptied: a client joining later registers the table only up
to the first empty slot (CG_RegisterSounds, CG_RegisterGraphics), so a gap would hide everything after
it. Clients already connected register the new name when the configstring changes. Names starting
with "*" (weather commands, player-model sounds) never take a reused slot: /admweather claims its
block by appending and checks that it is contiguous.

The number of reuses a map allows is capped (RP_SLOT_REUSE_FX, RP_SLOT_REUSE_MODELS in g_local.h):
each client keeps everything it has registered until the map changes, and has limits of its own.

Sound slots work the same way for the names only /playsound asked for (level.rp_slot_ps_sound), with
one difference: /playsound holds at most RP_PLAYSOUND_POOL of them at once, so past that a new name
takes the one played least recently even while the table has room -- see RP_PlaySoundIndex(). A
"*" sound name (a player-model sound) is never written into a reused slot: the client does not
register those, so it would go on playing the handle of the sound the slot held before
(CG_ConfigStringModified, EV_GENERAL_SOUND in cg_event.c).

GalaxyRP: [Slot Reuse] the sound slot for a /playsound name, or 0 with the reason in reason.

A name already in the table plays at no cost: the map's own, or one of /playsound's (the played time is
noted). A new name goes into the table marked as /playsound's while /playsound holds fewer than
RP_PLAYSOUND_POOL slots; after that it takes the /playsound slot played least recently that no sound
still on its way to the clients uses, overwriting it in place. That is a reuse, counted against
RP_SLOT_REUSE_SOUNDS for the map. A "*" name only ever goes into a free slot (see the top).

So /playsound never holds more than RP_PLAYSOUND_POOL of the map's slots, nor more than that many names
of gamestate, and the rest stay for the map and the game -- which may in turn take an idle /playsound
slot when the table or the gamestate is full (G_FindConfigstringIndex -> RP_SlotReclaim).

GlobalUse

GalaxyRP fix: [Entity System] every entity that uses another -- G_UseTargets2() for all target_*,
trigger_*, func_* and path_corner firing, target_relay's random pick, ICARUS "use", RP_LiftCallUse --
reaches the next one's use function through here, so this is the one place that can see a chain of
uses nesting. Nothing bounded it. G_UseTargets2() only skips an entity that targets itself, so two
target_relays naming each other (three /entadd lines and a trigger) recursed until the stack
overflowed and the server process died, and a random target_relay could pick itself even past that
check. Worse, a loop that FANS OUT -- A targets "B" and two entities are named B, each targeting
"A" -- doubles its calls at every level, so a depth limit alone would still leave ~2^64 calls:
a hang instead of a crash.

So two limits, both far above anything a map does (a button that fires 300 lights is 300 calls at
depth 1; a long relay chain is a few dozen deep). 128 nested uses is a few hundred KB of stack at
most, well inside even a 1 MB main-thread stack:
  RP_MAX_USE_DEPTH   uses nested inside each other;
  RP_MAX_USE_CHAIN   uses in total under one outermost use (the count restarts at depth 0).
Past either, that use is skipped; the chain above it finishes normally. One log line per map names
the entity where it stopped. The counters live in level, so a new map always starts them at zero,
and the depth is restored on every return path.

G_KillBox

Kills all entities that would touch the proposed new positioning
of ent.  Ent should be unlinked before calling this!

GalaxyRP fix: [Telefrag] a telefrag must end with nobody standing inside anybody else. Stock JKA got
that for free -- the victim died and a corpse blocks nobody -- but here three things broke it:

  - the Death System downed the victim instead, and a downed player is a solid body, so the
    arrival and the victim stood inside each other and neither could move. G_Damage() kills on
    MOD_TELEFRAG outright now (the certain-death test in g_combat.c).
  - the damage can be turned away before it lands: allies, chat protection, private duels, the arena
    rules, noclip, an NPC a script made invulnerable. The victim survives, still solid. They keep
    their protection; the arrival walks out of them instead (RP_StartOverlapRelease, g_active.c).
  - an NPC coming out of a teleporter onto a player -- NPCs use trigger_teleport like players do, a
    script can fire target_teleporter with an NPC as activator, and trigger_hyperspace moves
    vehicles -- would kill that player outright now. It no longer telefrags players at all; it
    walks out of them the same way. NPCs arriving on NPCs still telefrag them, as stock.
    (Spawning is not a case: NPC_Begin() (NPC_spawn.c) waits while NPC_SpotWouldTelefrag() finds a
    solid body in the spot, and its call here only comes after that check has passed, so a newly
    spawned NPC never lands on a live player. An NPC spawned not-solid, spawnflag 64, skips both.)

And a body already passing through bodies -- /admsolid, /admghost, /admholo, /npc effect, or the
tail of a release -- on either side cannot get stuck, so it is neither telefragged nor released.

	// with the zyk_duel_tournament_allow_teams cvar that gated it, so tournaments are now always 1v1.
	//
	// It had been unreachable for logged-in players for years in any case: the condition required
	// sess.amrpgmode < 2 on BOTH players, but amrpgmode only ever holds 0 (not logged in) or 2 (logged
	// in) -- the value 1 is long dead, see the "always 2, kept for backwards compatibility" note in
	// g_cmds.c. So on any server where people log in, the cvar advertised a feature that could never
	// actually be used, and only two logged-OUT players could ever team up.
	//
	// The branches that read it have since been unpicked too: level.duel_allies[], the two
	// duelist_N_ally_id slots and the three duel_leaderboard_ally_* fields are gone from
	// level_locals_t, and with them the ally handling in the tournament state machine (g_main.c)
	// and the " / ally" columns in /dueltable and /duelmatches (g_cmds.c). Removing them changed
	// no behaviour: every one of those branches tested a value that was permanently -1.

	// GalaxyRP fix: [Quests] the jawa_seller Use branch used to be here -- pressing Use on a
	// jawa_seller NPC printed a hint to type /stuff and played a taunt animation. It was the only
	// code anywhere that needed that NPC to exist, and the NPC itself has gone with the three
	// zyk_quest_*.npc asset files. /buy and /stuff are plain command rows with no NPC dependency of
	// any kind, so the shop is unaffected; the two "Jawa Seller:" lines Cmd_Buy_f prints are chat
	// text with no entity behind them and are deliberately kept.

	// GalaxyRP fix: [RPG Class] Bounty Hunter Upgrade sentry gun recovery removed — rpg_class is permanently 0
	// GalaxyRP fix: [RPG Class] Bounty Hunter Upgrade force field recovery removed — rpg_class is permanently 0

==============
G_CanUseInFrontOf

"Would pressing Use right now activate a usable world entity?" -- the predicate behind the
gfx/hud/useableHint hand icon (/settings 4). Read-only: it never touches any entity or player state.

GalaxyRP: [Use hint] Jedi Academy SINGLE PLAYER has this feature; multiplayer never did. SP's version
(CanUseInfrontOf, code/game/g_utils.cpp) cannot be ported -- its cgame reads server entities directly
through centity_t::gent, starts the trace from client->renderInfo.eyePoint (a server-only struct that
is never networked) and calls gi.trace from client render code. None of that exists across the MP
VM boundary, and nothing about usability appears in entityState_t or playerState_t. So the detection
runs here, on the server, and only its one-bit result is networked (ps.stats[STAT_USE_HINT]).

Scope: world geometry only, by two routes, because the Use key has two ways of reaching a door.
The first is the entity directly ahead being player-usable in its own right (ValidUseTarget, the
TryUse branch). The second is standing inside a USE_BUTTON trigger that fires it --
G_UsableTriggerInRange() above. The second route matters more than it looks: a func_door carrying a
targetname gets no touch-trigger of its own and is opened by whatever targets it, so most map doors
and lifts are reached that way and carry no SVF_PLAYER_USABLE at all. The first version of this
feature had only route one and stayed dark on exactly the doors players use most.

Still NOT covered, deliberately: the Use key's other jobs -- vehicles, jetpacks, body dragging,
corpse dragging, the jawa seller, NPC follow orders, dispensers and helping up a downed player. None
of those involve SVF_PLAYER_USABLE or a trigger, and covering them means restructuring TryUse itself
into a query mode, which is a separate job.

This is a separate function rather than a query flag on TryUse precisely so TryUse -- live, heavily
used code -- is not restructured for a HUD hint. The cost of that choice is that the two can drift
apart, and they already did once: this function used to bail on ps.m_iVehicleNum alone while TryUse
only bails when the referenced vehicle actually exists. They are kept adjacent here for that reason.
If you change the guards, the trace or the ValidUseTarget gate in either one, change it in both.

// for a combat knockdown and by the admin /paralyze command -- and cleared in four:
// RP_ReleaseFromDownedState() (the complete counterpart, used by the countdown's auto-release and by
// /unparalyze), help_up() (/getup and /helpup), player_die(), and G_Damage()'s branch for finishing
// off a player who was already down. While the bit is set the player is lying incapacitated, serving
// pers.downedTime: rp_downed_timer seconds for a knockdown, or whatever /paralyze was given.
//
// This matters because a downed player is NOT dead as far as the rest of the code is concerned:
// paralyze_player() leaves them on RP_DOWNED_HEALTH health, so every "health <= 0", "EF_DEAD" and "PM_DEAD" test
// in the codebase says they are perfectly alive. Nothing about the downed state blocks an action on
// its own -- the only reason a downed player cannot swing a weapon or use Grip/Lightning/Drain/Mind
// Trick/Push is that ClientThink_real() pins forceHandExtend at HANDEXTEND_KNOCKDOWN, and those
// particular actions happen to refuse to run during any hand-extend state. That is inherited vanilla
// knockdown behaviour, not a rule anyone wrote for this system, and everything it does not happen to
// cover (Heal, Speed, Rage, Protect, Absorb, Seeing, the team powers, and every holdable item) was
// reachable while downed. Callers that must not be usable while downed test this explicitly instead
// of relying on that side effect.
//
// Existing bit-6 tests elsewhere were deliberately left as they are; this is for new call sites.

// /paralyze now also sets the ADMIN_PARALYSIS bit and this answers which state a player is in. The ADMIN_PARALYSIS bit is never set
// without bit 6, so a caller that only wants "can this player act?" should use G_PlayerIsDowned().
