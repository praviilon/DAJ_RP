// GalaxyRP fix: [Force] these two replace the zyk_max_force_power server cvar, which is gone. It
// was never safely configurable: fd.forcePower is an 8-bit netfield (see PSF(fd.forcePower) in
// qcommon/msg.cpp -- it appears in all three playerState tables at that width), so any pool above
// 255 wraps modulo 256 on the client. It also silently set the cost of Force Heal and Shield Heal,
// and the cgame force HUD hardcodes a full bar at 100 regardless (cg_draw.c), so no value other
// than the shipped one displayed correctly anyway.
//
// RP_MAX_FORCE_POWER is the ceiling a logged-in character reaches at Force Power skill 5. 250 is
// the practical maximum and should not be raised further: the netfield tops out at 255, leaving
// only five units of slack. That slack is never actually used -- every path that adds force
// (WP_ForcePowerRegenerate, the Absorb and Team Energize grants in w_force.c, Drain, the Healing
// Crystal tick in g_active.c, the force pickup in g_misc.c) clamps in the same statement or the
// very next line, inside the same frame, so the value can never be above the maximum at the point
// a snapshot is built -- but there is no room left for a future path that does not clamp.
//
// Note that raising this does not make anyone cast faster. Force regenerates at a flat 1 point per
// g_forceRegenTime (200ms) whatever the pool size, and the forcePowerNeeded[] costs are fixed
// absolute numbers, so a bigger pool buys burst capacity and a longer refill (250 points is 50
// seconds from empty), not a higher sustained rate.
// GalaxyRP fix: [Entity System] shortest interval an fx_runner carrying the damage spawnflag may
// re-apply its G_RadiusDamage at. With "delay" and "random" unset the think re-armed for the very
// next frame, so the damage landed at server framerate.
#define RP_FX_RUNNER_MIN_DAMAGE_DELAY	100

// GalaxyRP: [Weather] /admweather reserves a fixed, contiguous block of CS_EFFECTS slots and
// rewrites EVERY slot in it on every change, with a counter appended so each string differs from
// the last and therefore actually re-broadcasts.
//
// This shape is forced by how weather works. The engine's world-effect parser is a command stream,
// not a state assignment: "*rain" then "*snow" gives rain AND snow, and the only removal it offers
// is "*clear", which wipes everything. Meanwhile a client that joins later replays the whole
// CS_EFFECTS table in SLOT ORDER (cg_main.c), while a client already connected runs each string as
// its configstring changes. So the only way both populations end up looking at the same sky is for
// the teardown to be part of every rebuild rather than a separate command someone has to remember.
//
// The layers are right-aligned in the block and every slot below them holds the teardown, so a
// shorter recipe simply grows the padding and the surplus "*clear"s always land before the layers.
// The padding must never be an EMPTY configstring: the client's replay loop stops at the first
// empty slot, so a blank would silently hide every slot above it from everyone who joins later.
// GalaxyRP fix: [Configstrings] the gamestate's own ceiling, which no part of the server enforces
// -- see the long comment on G_FindConfigstringIndex in g_utils.c. The headroom is for configstrings
// this budget cannot see coming: a player connecting writes their userinfo into CS_PLAYERS after we
// have already decided we had room. It does not make the limit airtight, because nothing in the game
// module can refuse a connecting player's configstring, but it keeps a full-to-the-brim gamestate
// from being tipped over by the next join.
#define ZYK_GAMESTATE_HEADROOM		1024
#define ZYK_GAMESTATE_BUDGET		(MAX_GAMESTATE_CHARS - ZYK_GAMESTATE_HEADROOM)

// GalaxyRP fix: [Configstrings] how long G_RunFrame waits for the engine to finish writing the
// gamestate before taking the map-load count anyway. SV_SpawnServer writes CS_SYSTEMINFO four
// frames -- 400ms of level time -- after InitGame returns, so this only has to outlast that; it is
// a backstop in case a future engine never writes it at all, not the path that normally fires.
#define ZYK_GAMESTATE_BASELINE_WAIT	2000

// GalaxyRP fix: [Configstrings] one "already reported" flag per indexed table, so a table filling up
// is logged once instead of once per refused name. See zyk_cs_table_slot() in g_utils.c.
#define ZYK_CS_TABLES				8

// GalaxyRP fix: [Entity System] slots held back from every spawn a player or admin can drive, so the
// transient allocations ordinary play depends on -- G_TempEntity for every effect and sound event,
// missiles, gibs -- always have somewhere to go. G_Spawn() cannot fail gracefully: it has ~70 call
// sites, G_TempEntity among them dereferences the result immediately, and when it runs out it calls
// trap->Error(ERR_DROP). Refusing the controllable spawns early is what keeps it from ever getting
// there.
//
// GalaxyRP fix: [Entity System] and what ERR_DROP does is worse than the name suggests, which is
// worth stating once here because several comments in this mod reach for it. gi.Error is Com_Error
// itself (sv_gameapi.cpp), and Com_Error opens with:
//
//     // ERR_DROPs on dedicated drop to an interactive console
//     // which doesn't make sense for dedicated as it's generally run unattended
//     if ( com_dedicated && com_dedicated->integer ) { code = ERR_FATAL; }
//
// ERR_FATAL runs CL_Shutdown, SV_Shutdown, Com_Shutdown and then Sys_Error, so on a dedicated
// server -- which is every server this mod is played on -- an ERR_DROP raised from game code is a
// PROCESS EXIT, not a disconnect. Nobody reconnects; the server is gone until something restarts
// it. (More than three ERR_DROPs inside 100ms escalate the same way even on a listen server.)
// That is the cost these guards exist to avoid, and the reason the one surviving call in G_Spawn
// writes its reason to the log first.
#define ZYK_ENTITY_RESERVE			64

// GalaxyRP fix: [Weather] was 4, which an ordinary map overruns without trying: SP_CreateSnow
// registers three commands on its own (*snow, *fog, *constantwind) and SP_CreateWind up to
// five, so anything past the cap was dropped and /admweather default could not put it back.
// This shares the ZYK_WEATHER_MAX_LAYERS budget with the admin's own layers, so it cannot go

// own forcePowerMax now, which for a logged-out player is this same number. Logged-out players
// only ever reach Force level 3, where the dearest thing in forcePowerNeeded[] is Heal at 70, so
// nothing is priced out of reach at this number -- it costs them burst capacity against a

#define RP_MAX_FORCE_POWER_LOGGED_OUT	100

// GalaxyRP fix: [Force] a logged-in character's force pool is this fraction of RP_MAX_FORCE_POWER

// max level is 5 (see skills[] in g_cmds.c), so a maxed character ended up with 125% of the
// supposed maximum. Dividing by the skill's actual max level makes level 5 land exactly on
// RP_MAX_FORCE_POWER, matching how set_max_shield() already divides by the Max Shield skill's own
// max level of 5. 250 divides by 5 exactly, so the five steps are round: 50/100/150/200/250.

	// account-wide (Accounts.PlayerSettings, shared by every character on the account), which made the
	// 3 shop upgrades account-wide too -- buying one on any character silently granted it on every other
	// character on the same account. The 3 upgrades now live in pers.skill_levels[38] instead (the dead,
	// per-character UniqueSkill DB column -- see its doc comment on skill_levels below), keeping the same
	// bit values 0/1/2. See the matching GalaxyRP fix comments in Cmd_Buy_f (g_cmds.c) and every other
	// reader migrated alongside it (g_combat.c, g_weapon.c, bg_pmove.c, g_active.c, g_items.c). Like the
	// other already-retired bits below (7, 12, 14, 15), bits 0-2 were never reachable via /settings in
	// the first place -- settings_number_to_bit[] in Cmd_Settings_f (g_cmds.c) never mapped any
	// player-facing settings number to bit 0, 1, or 2 -- so no /settings-side change was needed to
	// "disable" them; this doc update is the only thing marking them retired here.
	// 3 - Eternity Power
	// 4 - Universe Power
	// 5 - Sense Health Toggle (/settings 1). Used to be "Custom Language", whose only reader went with
	//     the RPG tutorial; reused rather than retired. Inverted (clear == ON, set == OFF), and new
	//     accounts are created with it SET so it starts OFF -- see insert_accounts_table_row() (g_cmds.c).
	//     Existing accounts keep whatever the old Language choice left: English (clear) reads as ON.
	// GalaxyRP fix: [Settings] bit 6 used to be "Allow Force Powers from allies" -- that setting was
	// removed from /settings entirely (force powers between allies are now always allowed, see the fix
	// comment at its old gate in w_force.c's ForcePowerUsableOn()), freeing the bit for reuse rather
	// than retiring it. It is now the Use Hint (/settings 4): whether the gfx/hud/useableHint hand
	// icon is drawn while looking at a usable world entity. Inverted like the other toggles here
	// (clear == ON, set == OFF), and because a zeroed player_settings therefore reads as ON, new
	// accounts are created with this bit SET so the feature starts OFF -- see the hardcoded default in
	// insert_accounts_table_row() (g_cmds.c), the same mechanism bit 13 uses.
	// IMPORTANT, for anyone reusing a "free" bit after this one: free of readers is not the same as
	// free of data. Bit 6 was /settings 2, "Allow Force Powers from allies", a live player-facing
	// toggle right up until the settings cleanup that retired it -- so accounts that predate this
	// feature hold whatever that player last set, not zero. In practice a pre-existing account starts
	// with the hint ON or OFF depending on a choice its owner made about an unrelated setting years
	// ago. That is accepted here rather than migrated (a deliberate call), and /settings 4 reports and
	// changes the current state either way. Bits 17-25 and 30-31 have never been used by any setting
	// in this mod's history and are the ones to reach for when a predictable default actually matters.
	// (Bit 16 was one of them until /settings 5 took it -- see 16 below.)

	// 7 - Show magic cast in chat
	// GalaxyRP fix: [Settings] bit 9 ("Allow Screen Message") documentation removed here -- that

	// GalaxyRP fix: [Settings] bit 10 ("Use healing force only at allied players") documentation
	// removed here -- that setting has been removed from /settings entirely; Team Heal and Team
	// Energize in FFA now always restrict to allies outside non-RPG mode (see the fix comments at
	// their eligibility checks in w_force.c).
	// GalaxyRP fix: [Settings] bit 11 used to be "Start With Saber" -- that setting was removed from
	// /settings entirely (a player who owns a saber now always starts with it equipped, see the fix
	// comment at its old gate in zyk_load_common_settings()), freeing the bit up for reuse rather than
	// retiring it. It's now "Activate Saber on Spawn" (/settings 3): whether the blade is ignited

	// alongside the weapon-selection code in zyk_load_common_settings().

	// guardians the player had beaten (bits 4-12, Water through Ice). It was declaration-only:
	// nothing ever wrote it, which is precisely why several dead branches gated on it were removed
	// in earlier passes. Comments elsewhere still name it when explaining those removals.

	// GalaxyRP fix: [Quests] removed hunter_quest_progress and eternity_quest_progress here — both
	// were write-only (only ever reset to 0), with zero readers anywhere in the codebase.

	// GalaxyRP fix: [Quests] universe_quest_progress used to be declared here, the player's step count
	// through the Universe Quest. Nothing in the tree ever wrote it -- no assignment, no database
	// column (the schema has no quest table), no session string, no spawn key -- so it sat at the zero
	// ClientConnect's memset gives it. Its readers all tested for a nonzero step (== 15 for Challenge
	// Mode, == NUM_OF_UNIVERSE_QUEST_OBJ for the completion bonus in player_die), so none could fire.
	// The last of them went in this pass and the field goes with them.

	// GalaxyRP fix: [Dead Fields] universe_quest_counter used to be declared here, holding the bit
	// values documented above plus bit 29 for Challenge Mode. It was declaration-only; nothing ever
	// wrote it, which is why the branches gated on it (including the Challenge-Mode-only path noted
	// in g_combat.c) were removed as unreachable. universe_quest_progress, a different field that
	// survived that pass with one live reader, has since gone the same way -- see the note above.

	// GalaxyRP fix: [Quests] removed universe_quest_objective_control here — its sole reader was the
	// dead universe_quest_messages==-10000 block in g_combat.c's player_die(), removed alongside it.

	// GalaxyRP fix: [Quests] universe_quest_artifact_holder_id used to be declared here, naming the npc
	// holding the artifact in the third Universe Quest objective. The only value ever assigned to it
	// anywhere was -1 (the NPC_spawn.c init and the initialize_rpg_skills reset), while both its
	// readers tested `!= -1` -- the per-frame PW_FORCE_BOON top-up in G_RunFrame and the
	// "zyk_quest_artifact" targetname stamp in TossClientItems. Neither could ever fire; both went in
	// this pass, along with the field.

	// GalaxyRP fix: [Quests] universe_quest_messages and universe_quest_timer used to be declared here,
	// driving the Universe Quest's timed events. Both were write-only: the only values ever assigned
	// were 0 (the initialize_rpg_skills resets) and, for the timer, a cooldown bump in magic_disable's
	// npc branch. Their readers all tested negative sentinels (-10000, -2000) that nothing ever wrote.
	// Those readers were removed in earlier passes; the writers and the fields go in this one.

	// GalaxyRP fix: [Magic] the quest-power state used to live here: quest_power_status (the
	// "using / hit by power N" bitfield), quest_power_usage_timer, the hit counters, the
	// quest_power*_timer / quest_target*_timer / quest_power_user*_id groups,
	// quest_debounce1_timer, quest_power_effect1_id and magic_power itself. Every writer other
	// than a reset lived in the magic effect functions, which have been deleted; every reader
	// in live code tested a bit nothing could set any more and has been simplified away (G_Damage,
	// ClientThink_real, ClientTimerActions, PM_CheckJump, PmoveSingle, the force-power checks in
	// w_force.c, Player_FireFlameThrower, TryGrapple).

	// GalaxyRP fix: [Quests] light_quest_messages and light_quest_timer used to be declared here,
	// driving the Light Quest's timed events. Both were write-only by the end -- reset to 0 in
	// initialize_rpg_skills, with the timer also bumped by magic_disable's npc branch -- and no reader
	// survived anywhere in the tree. Removed with the rest of the quest-progress fields.

	// GalaxyRP fix: [Quests] hunter_quest_timer and hunter_quest_messages used to be declared here,
	// driving the Dark Quest's timed events. hunter_quest_messages was additionally documented as the
	// Guardian of Universe's "already spawned the other guardians" flag; that second use went with the
	// guardian spawn chain in an earlier pass. Both fields were write-only afterwards -- reset to 0 in
	// initialize_rpg_skills and read nowhere -- so both are removed here.

	// GalaxyRP fix: [Quests] eternity_quest_timer used to be declared here, pacing the Eternity Quest
	// riddles. Write-only by the end: reset to 0 in initialize_rpg_skills, read nowhere in the tree.
	// Removed with the rest of the quest-progress fields.

	// GalaxyRP fix: [Guardian] guardian_mode field (and its boss-value documentation) removed here —
	// it is permanently 0 with zero live readers/writers left anywhere in the codebase (spawn_boss,
	// its sole setter, has no callers).

	// GalaxyRP fix: [Guardian] guardian_timer used to be here, pacing the quest guardians' special
	// abilities. Its last reader went with the quest_mage chain, leaving it write-only; the write
	// inside magic_disable() and the reset in Cmd_... (g_cmds.c) have gone with it.

	// GalaxyRP fix: [Guardian] guardian_invoked_by_id field removed here — it is permanently -1
	// with zero live readers/writers left anywhere in the codebase (spawn_boss, its sole setter,
	// has no callers).
